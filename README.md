# CYBERDIAG : What is it ? How does it work ?

This app is used to create a first cyber-security diagnostic for compagnies or consultants working in insurance (for instance) and filling the surveys with the clients.

### How does it work ?

When you arrive on the app, you have to possibilities :
- You are already registered and you sign in
- You are not already registerd, and you create an account
![Login page](Screenshots/Login.png)

 Create an account 
Just clik on the button "CrÃ©er un compte" and the follow the different steps, that is to say fill the fields
- Firstname
- Lastname
- Company name
- Phone number (french format)
- Email 
- Password with security (12 caraters, one special, numbers and a Capital letter). If the two passwords are not the same, a modal will be opened to alert the error
- It is not possible to register if the user doesn't accept the legal terms (link to legal terms page)

![Error message when different passwords](Screenshots/Register.png)


As the user click on the register button, there is modal to alert that an email is sent to confirm the account creation.
For now, the function is half usable because it wil not send a real email, but you have to check the backend console and click on the link in the console (more details on backend readme).


### User dashbaord
When a user is connected, he has an access to the homepage which is a dashboard with all the surveys he has filled (or nothing for the first connection).

To create a new survey, he has to click on the button "Nouveau questionnaire", which opens a new modal. Then he has to fill the different fields and register.
He will see the new survey title on his dashboard.

To begin the survey the user just created, he has to click on the pen button of the Actions column. 

The Actions column functions :
- Pen : fill the survey --> when the survey is already completed, the pen becomes a green check icon
- Break arrow : see charts page
- Wrench : change some details of the survey (title, client name, creation date, type of company)
- Trash : delete a survey and results


For the moment, only 2 types of companies have a survey model:
- TPE : the survey is good
- PME : the survey is fake (it allows to test the application)

### Admin dashboard

With an admin connection, the admin has a dashboard with all the users of the app.
For each one, he can add some comments by cliking on the pen option of the right. It will allow to have a tracking of the user : he has been phoned, he wants to be contacted, etc.

The different topics appear as cards to display. Just click on the first one and the questions will appear.
